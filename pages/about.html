        <span>
            I'm a soon-to-be graduate from UC Santa Barbara and creative conceptor in the advertising industry. 
            From staging a viral roller coaster photo to becoming a Parisian for 4 months, I live to take big ideas and create experiences to bring them life.

            The growth of digital spaces on local and global scales fascinates me, and I'd love to showcase how my background with social/content strategy provides valuable insight for creative executions across multiple channels.
