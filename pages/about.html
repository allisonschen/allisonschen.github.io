        <p id="text">I'm a soon-to-be graduate from UC Santa Barbara and creative conceptor in 
            the advertising industry. From staging a viral roller coaster photo to becoming 
            a Parisian for 4 months, I live to take big ideas and create experiences to 
            bring them life.
            <br><br>
             The growth of digital spaces on local and global scales fascinates me, 
             and I'd love to showcase how my background with social/content strategy provides 
             valuable insight for creative executions across multiple channels.
